### The local gate stage killed the run while tearing itself down

**Was:** any supervised cycle in an affected repo died mid-gate. The process
raised inside teardown, so the run neither passed nor failed, it just ended.

`_link_dep_dirs` symlinks the repo's dependency directories (`.venv`,
`node_modules`) into the staged copy so the gate can import them without a
reinstall. Teardown then removed the stage with
`shutil.rmtree(root, ignore_errors=True)`.

`rmtree` deletes entries by bare name against a directory file descriptor
(`os.unlink(entry.name, dir_fd=topfd)`). The substrate patches `os.unlink` and
resolves the candidate through `Path.resolve()`, which **follows the symlink**
onto the real `.venv` inside the open workspace. That is a tracked path, so the
patch demanded a scope:

```
UnscopedMutationError: Workspace mutation 'os.unlink' for .venv requires an
active scope. Wrap edits in fork()/merge() before mutating the workspace.
```

`UnscopedMutationError` derives from the substrate's error base, **not** from
`OSError`, so `ignore_errors=True` did not swallow it and the exception left
teardown and left the run.

**Blast radius, established by probe** (workspace open, cwd at the repo root,
four stage shapes torn down):

| stage holds | in-process rmtree |
| --- | --- |
| real files only | clean |
| a file whose bare name also exists at the repo root | clean |
| a symlink resolving **into** the workspace | `UnscopedMutationError` |
| a symlink resolving outside the workspace | clean |

So the trigger is the symlink, not the file name and not the working directory.
An earlier reading of this defect blamed a bare name resolved against the cwd;
that is wrong — `_resolve_path_with_dir_fd` honours `dir_fd`, and the
`name_collision` row above refutes it. The affected repos are the ones where
`_link_dep_dirs` has something to link: a `.venv` or `node_modules` at the root,
which is most Python and most Node repos. Both teardown sites were affected —
the warmed `LocalGateStage` and the plain gate's temporary directory, whose
`TemporaryDirectory` cleanup is the same in-process `rmtree`.

**Fix:** `_remove_tree` deletes a staged tree from a child interpreter, which
carries none of the patches. Pinned by `tests/test_gate_teardown.py`, including
one case against the real substrate in a throwaway workspace; reverting the fix
turns those tests red with the error above.
